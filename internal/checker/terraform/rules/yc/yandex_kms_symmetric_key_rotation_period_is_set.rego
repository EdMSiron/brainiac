# METADATA
# title: "Rotate KMS Symmetric Key"
# description: "This policy ensures that a Key Management Service (KMS) symmetric key undergoes regular rotation. Key rotation is a security best practice that helps mitigate potential risks by generating a new key while retaining access to the existing one during the transition."
